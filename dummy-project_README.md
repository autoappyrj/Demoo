# Demoo — Dummy Project

A minimal dummy Node.js project added for demonstration and testing.

Files included:
- `index.js` — simple entrypoint and exported helper
- `package.json` — minimal metadata and scripts
- `.gitignore` — common ignores
git checkout -b add-dummy-project
mkdir -p dummy-project
# create files (or copy them from this message)
cd dummy-project
npm install   # optional, no dependencies
npm start
```

What it does
- Prints a short message to stdout when run.
- Exports a tiny `greet` function that can be required by other code or tests.
